# Gotg Jena RDF API
An API (Application Programming Interface) that returns the alias of a chosen Marvel comic book character from a Jena RDF (Resource Data Framework) document containing descriptive information about the Guardians of the Galaxy. Included here are a Java file and an RDF file written in the markup language XML along with brief Powerpoint tutorial slides explaining how the API functions. Implemented using Java and Eclipse IDE.
